# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Players take turns selecting tiles on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If all tiles are filled without a winner, it's a draw.

## Features

- Player turns: The game alternates between "X" and "O" players.
- Winning detection: The game checks for winning combinations.
- Draw detection: The game determines if all tiles are filled without a winner.
- New game: A "New Game" button starts a new round.
- Reset game: A "Reset" button resets the game to its initial state.
